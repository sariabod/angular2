In order to start the seed use:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/sariabod/angular2 
cd angular2-seed
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start
# api document for the app
# npm run build.docs

# dev build
npm run build.dev
# prod build
npm run build.prod

# dev build of multiple applications (by default the value of --app is "app")
npm start -- --app baz
npm start -- --app foo
npm start -- --app bar
```

_Does not rely on any global dependencies._

```bash
npm start -- --port 8080 --reload-port 4000 --base /my-app/
```

## Environment configuration

If you have different environments and you need to configure them to use different end points, settings, etc. you can use the files `dev.ts` or `prod.ts` in`./tools/env/`. The name of the file is environment you want to use.

The can be specified by using:

```bash
npm start -- --config-env ENV_NAME
```

Currently the `ENV_NAME`s are `dev`, `prod`, `staging`, but you can simply add a different file `"ENV_NAME.ts".` file in order to alter extra such environments.

```bash
npm test

# Development. Your app will be watched by karma
# on each change all your specs will be executed.
npm run test.watch
# NB: The command above might fail with a "EMFILE: too many open files" error.
# Some OS have a small limit of opened file descriptors (256) by default
# and will result in the EMFILE error.
# You can raise the maximum of file descriptors by running the command below:
ulimit -n 10480


# code coverage (istanbul)
# auto-generated at the end of `npm test`
# view coverage report:
npm run serve.coverage

# e2e (aka. end-to-end, integration) - In three different shell windows
# Make sure you don't have a global instance of Protractor

# npm install webdriver-manager <- Install this first for e2e testing
# npm run webdriver-update <- You will need to run this the first time
npm run webdriver-start
npm run serve.e2e
npm run e2e

# e2e live mode - Protractor interactive mode
# Instead of last command above, you can use:
npm run e2e.live
